# Hybrid Skeleton

## Check out the documentation, migration and development instructions on [Confluence](http://tlvconfluence01:8090/display/WFM/hybrid+angular+7+webapp+skeleton)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.4.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server on  `http://localhost:4200/`.

make sure to configure your nginx according to the description in confluence.

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

Run `npm run build-prod` for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests **once** via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).


Or run the test via your webstorm karma runner.
It will leave the karma server running, which will make re-running tests much faster.

It will watch for changes in your code and tests so no need to restart the karma server

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e-suite_#` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
